# How to remember Que vs Qué?

### First, definitions.

**Que** *(without accent)* is [translated](https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/que) as **"that"**

**Qué** (*with* accent) is [translated](https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/qu%C3%A9) as **"what"** 

### So how do we remember which is which?

Here's my mnemonic:\

When someone speaks with a heavy **accent**, they can be hard to understand - and you might even respond with **"What?"**

Therefore, the **Qué** *with* an accent is "What" - because a thick accent will make you say - "What?"
