First, definitions.

**Que** *(without accent)* is translated as **"that"**           [\[SpanishDict entry on Que]](https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/que)

**Qué** (*with* accent) is translated as **"what"**         [\[SpanishDict entry on Qué]](https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/qu%C3%A9)

So how do we remember which is which?

Here's my mnemonic:\

When someone speaks with a heavy **accent**, they can be hard to understand - and you might even respond with **"What?"**

Therefore, the **Qué** *with* an accent is "What" - because a thick accent will make you say "What?"
