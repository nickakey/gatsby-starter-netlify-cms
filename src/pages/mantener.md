## Can't remember the meaning of Mantener? Here's a trick. 

Mantener: [translated](https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/mantener) as "to hold"

##### Here's my mnemonic:

Tener means "to have", so I think a "man has" a cup of coffee, and I visualize a man **holding it!**

**man tener**

to

**man has** 

to

vizualizing **man has a cup of coffee**

to

**He's holding it!**
